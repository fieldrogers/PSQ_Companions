this file is a repository of useful git commands and wisdom!

To get started in a new directory: 
   - create a new .git folder:
$git init

To take an existing project and make it into a git repository:
   - need to add it!
$ git add <file> # repeat for every file
$git commit -m 'initial project version'

to check the status of files:
$git status


Two phases in putting a file in the repository: 1. stage it (git add) 2. commit it (git commit)

To track differences:
$git diff #tells you what you've changed but not yet staged (added) - compares working directory to staging area
