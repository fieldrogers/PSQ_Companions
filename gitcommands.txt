this file is a repository of useful git commands and wisdom!

To get started in a new directory: 
   - create a new .git folder:
$git init


***************

To take an existing project and make it into a git repository, or to update a repository:
   - need to add it!
$ git add <file> # repeat for every file
$git commit -m 'initial project version'
the -m flag allows you to add your comment inline

to check the status of files:
$git status

NOTE you can commit everything without staging by using the '-a' flag in git commit!

***************

Tracking Differences:

Two phases in putting a file in the repository: 1. stage it (git add) 2. commit it (git commit) (unless you commit with -a!) 

To track differences: note that git diff does NOT use emacs - have to use the annoying in line editor
$git diff #tells you what you've changed but not yet staged (added) - compares working directory to staging area
$git diff --cached # tells you the changes that have been staged (added)

********************

To add to github: 

this only happens the first time: 
need to make a repository on github
$ git remote add origin <remote repository URL>
$git remote -v # to verify

this happens every time you want to update github:
$git push origin master
